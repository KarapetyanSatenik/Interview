## 1 Data Types

### 1.1 What are primitive data types

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined
6. bigint
7. symbol

### 1.2 What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

   There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below

   1. **Object constructor:**

      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

      ```javascript
      var object = new Object();
      ```

   2. **Object's create method:**

      The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

      ```javascript
      var object = Object.create(null);
      ```

   3. **Object literal syntax:**

      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
           name: "Sudheer"
           age: 34
      };

      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
      ```

      **Note:** This is an easiest way to create an object

   4. **Function constructor:**

      Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

      ```javascript
      function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 21;
      }
      var object = new Person("Sudheer");
      ```

   5. **Function constructor with prototype:**

      This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

      ```javascript
      function Person() {}
      Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
      var object = new Person();
      ```

      This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

      ```javascript
      function func {};

      new func(x, y, z);
      ```

      **(OR)**

      ```javascript
      // Create a new instance using function prototype.
      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

      // Call the function
      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
      ```

   6. **ES6 Class syntax:**

      ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

      ```javascript
      class Person {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      }

      var object = new Person("Sudheer");
      ```

   7. **Singleton pattern:**

      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

      ```javascript
      var object = new (function () {
        this.name = "Sudheer";
      })();
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.3 What is undefined property

The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

```javascript
var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
console.log(typeof user); //undefined
```

Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

```javascript
user = undefined;
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.4 What is null value

The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.
You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

```javascript
var user = null;
console.log(typeof user); //object
```

### 1.5 What is the difference between null and undefined

Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

| Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
| Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |
| The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |
| Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |
| Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |

### 1.6 What is the difference between window and document

Below are the main differences between window and document,

| Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
| By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                            |
| It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc              |

### 1.7 What is isNaN

The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

```javascript
isNaN("Hello"); //true
isNaN("100"); //false
```

### 1.8 What is the difference between let and var

You can list out the differences in a tabular format

| var                                                   | let                         |
 | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
| It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
| Variables will be hoisted                             | Hoisted but not initialized |

Let's take an example to see the difference,

```javascript
function userDetails(username) {
if (username) {
 console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
 console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
 let age = 30;
 var salary = 10000;
}
console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
userDetails("John");
```

### 1.9 What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables

Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,

| undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
| If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |

### 1.10 What are global variables

Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable

```javascript
msg = "Hello"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.11 What are the problems with global variables

The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.12 What is NaN property

The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

```javascript
Math.sqrt(-1);
parseInt("Hello");
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.13 What are classes in ES6

In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

```javascript
function Bike(model, color) {
this.model = model;
this.color = color;
}

Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
};
```

Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

```javascript
class Bike {
constructor(color, model) {
  this.color = color;
  this.model = model;
}

getDetails() {
  return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
}
}
```

### 1.14 How do you check whether a string contains a substring

There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

```javascript
var mainString = "hello",
subString = "hell";
mainString.includes(subString);
```

1. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

```javascript
var mainString = "hello",
subString = "hell";
mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
```

1. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

```javascript
var mainString = "hello",
regex = /hell/;
regex.test(mainString);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.15 How do you check if a key exists in an object

You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

```javascript
"key" in obj;
```

and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

```javascript
!("key" in obj);
```

1. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
```

1. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

```javascript
const user = {
name: "John",
};

console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.16 How do you copy properties from one object to other

You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the target object. The syntax would be as below,

```javascript
Object.assign(target, ...sources);
```

Let's take example with one source and one target object,

```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
```

As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

### 1.17 What is a proxy object

The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc. The syntax would be as follows,

```javascript
var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
```

Let's take an example of proxy object,

```javascript
var handler = {
get: function (obj, prop) {
  return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;
},
};

var p = new Proxy({}, handler);
p.a = 10;
p.b = null;

console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
console.log("c" in p, p.c); // false, 100
```

In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it

### 1.18 What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

 ```javascript
 const object = {
   a: "Good morning",
   b: 100,
 };

 for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
   console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'
   100;
 }
 ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.19 How can you get the list of keys of any object

You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

```javascript
const user = {
      name: "John",
      gender: "male",
      age: 40,
};

console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.20 How do you create an object with prototype

The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

```javascript
const user = {
      name: "John",
      printInfo: function () {
        console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
      },
};

const admin = Object.create(user);

admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
```

### 1.21 What is a WeakSet

WeakSet is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,

```javascript
new WeakSet([iterable]);
```

Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

```javascript
var ws = new WeakSet();
var user = {};
ws.add(user);
ws.has(user); // true
ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set
ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.22 What are the differences between WeakSet and Set

The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
Other differences are,

1. Sets can store any value Whereas WeakSets can store only collections of objects
2. WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
3. WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4. WeakSet is not iterable.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.23 What is a WeakMap

The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values. The syntax is looking like as below,

```javascript
new WeakMap([iterable]);
```

Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

```javascript
var ws = new WeakMap();
var user = {};
ws.set(user);
ws.has(user); // true
ws.delete(user); // removes user from the map
ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed
```

### 1.24 What are the differences between WeakMap and Map

The main difference is that references to key objects in Map are strong while references to key objects in WeakMap are weak. i.e, A key object in WeakMap can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
Other differences are,

1. Maps can store any key type Whereas WeakMaps can store only collections of key objects
2. WeakMap does not have size property unlike Map
3. WeakMap does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4. WeakMap is not iterable.

### 1.25 What is Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

```javascript
console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
```

The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

```javascript
var message;
console.log(message);
message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
```

In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

```javascript
message("Good morning"); //Good morning

function message(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
```

This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

### 1.26 How do you assign default values to variables

You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

```javascript
var a = b || c;
```

As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

## 2 Context, Scope proto and Prototype

### 2.1 What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind

The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

**Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

**Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

**bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(
 greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

### 2.2 What is scope in javascript

Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

###  2.3 What is the difference between proto and prototype

The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new

```javascript
new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
new Employee().prototype === undefined;
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 2.4 What is a prototype chain

**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or \***\*proto\*\*** property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through **Object.prototype**.

## 3JSON

### 3.1 What is JSON and its common operations

**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

**Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object

```javascript
JSON.parse(text);
```

**Stringification:** converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network

```javascript
JSON.stringify(object);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 3.2 How do you parse JSON string

When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

```javascript
var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 3.3 Why do you need JSON

When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 3.4 What is the purpose JSON stringify

When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

```javascript
var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 3.5 How do you define JSON arrays

JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

```javascript
"users":[
{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
{"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
{"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
]
```

## 4 Arrays Methods

### 4.1 What is the purpose of the array slice method

The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

Some of the examples of this method are,

```javascript
let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
```

**Note:** Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 4.2 What is the purpose of the array splice method

The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

Some of the examples of this method are,

```javascript
let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
```

**Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

## 5 Functions

### 5.1 What are lambda or arrow functions

An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.2 What is a first class function

In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener

```javascript
const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
document.addEventListener("click", handler);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.3 What is a first order function

First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value.

```javascript
const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.4 What is a higher order function

Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.

```javascript
const firstOrderFunc = () =>
console.log("Hello, I am a First order function");
const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.5 What is a unary function

Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.

Let us take an example of unary function,

```javascript
const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.6 What is the currying function

Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,

```javascript
const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
```

Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.7 What is a pure function

A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.

Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

```javascript
//Impure
let numberArray = [];
const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);
//Pure
const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>
argNumberArray.concat([number]);

//Display the results
console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
```

As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value. . Whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.

Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.8 What are closures

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains

1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
2. Outer function’s variables
3. Global variables

Let's take an example of closure concept,

```javascript
function Welcome(name) {
  var greetingInfo = function (message) {
    console.log(message + " " + name);
  };
  return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
```

As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.9 What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

```javascript
(function () {
// logic here
})();
```

The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,

```javascript
(function () {
  var message = "IIFE";
  console.log(message);
})();
console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.10 What is a callback function

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

```javascript
function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 5.11 What is an anonymous function

An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,

```javascript
function (optionalParameters) {
//do something
}

const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
//do something
};

[1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
//do something
});
```

Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

```javascript
var x = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
var z = x(5, 10);
console.log(z); // 50
```

## 6 Async JavaScript

### 6.1 What is a promise

A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

```javascript
const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
// promise description
});
```

The usage of a promise would be as below,

```javascript
const promise = new Promise(
(resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("I'm a Promise!");
  }, 5000);
},
(reject) => {}
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
```

The action flow of a promise will be as below,

![Screenshot](img/promises.png)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.2 Why do you need a promise

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.3 What are the three states of promise

Promises have three states:

1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.4 Why do we need callbacks

The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

```javascript
function firstFunction() {
// Simulate a code delay
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("First function called");
}, 1000);
}
function secondFunction() {
console.log("Second function called");
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output;
// Second function called
// First function called
```

As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.5 What is a callback hell

Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

```javascript
async1(function(){
  async2(function(){
      async3(function(){
          async4(function(){
              ....
          });
      });
  });
});
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.6 What is promise chaining

The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
})
.then(function (result) {
  console.log(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
})
.then(function (result) {
  console.log(result); // 2
  return result * 3;
})
.then(function (result) {
  console.log(result); // 6
  return result * 4;
});
```

In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result \* 2.
3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result \* 3.
4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \* 4.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.7 What is promise.all

Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,

```javascript
Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
```

**Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.8 What is the purpose of the race method in promise

Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

```javascript
var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one");
});
var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two");
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {
console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
});
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.9 What is the use of setTimeout

The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Good morning");
}, 2000);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.10 What is the use of setInterval

The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

```javascript
setInterval(function () {
  console.log("Good morning");
}, 2000);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.11 What is an event loop

The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the async function has finished executing the code.
**Note:** It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 6.12 What is call stack

Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,

1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

```javascript
function hungry() {
  eatFruits();
}
function eatFruits() {
  return "I'm eating fruits";
}

// Invoke the `hungry` function
hungry();
```

The above code processed in a call stack as below,

1. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
2. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
3. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.
4. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

## 7 Common

### 7.1 What is a strict mode in javascript

Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

### 7.2 What are PWAs

Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

### 7.3 How do you validate an email in javascript

You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead of the client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.

 ```javascript
 function validateEmail(email) {
   var re =
     /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
   return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
 }
 ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

The above regular expression accepts unicode characters.

### 7.4 How do you get the current url with javascript

You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

```javascript
console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
```

###  7.5 What is tree shaking

Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 7.6 What is memoization

Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

```javascript
const memoizAddition = () => {
let cache = {};
return (value) => {
  if (value in cache) {
    console.log("Fetching from cache");
    return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
  } else {
    console.log("Calculating result");
    let result = value + 20;
    cache[value] = result;
    return result;
  }
};
};
// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
```

### 7.7 What are modules

Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 7.8 Why do you need modules

1. Maintainability
2. Reusability
3. Namespacing

### 7.9 How do you detect a mobile browser

You can use regex which returns a true or false value depending on whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.

```javascript
window.mobilecheck = function () {
var mobileCheck = false;
(function (a) {
  if (

### 7.10 How do you detect javascript disabled in the page

You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

```javascript
<script type="javascript">
  // JS related code goes here
</script>
<noscript>
  <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>
</noscript>
```

### 7.11 What is a rest parameter

Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

```javascript
function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
// ...
}
```

For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

```javascript
function total(…args) {
  let sum = 0;
  
  for(let i of args){
    sum+=i;
  }
  return sum;
}

console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
```

**Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

### 7.12 What is a spread operator

Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

```javascript
function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
```

### 7.13 How do you encode an URL

The encodeURI() function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.

```javascript
var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### 7.14 How do you decode an URL

The decodeURI() function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI().

```javascript
var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B

try {
  console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы"
} catch (e) {
  // catches a malformed URI
  console.error(e);
}
```

### Coding Exercise

#### 1. What is the output of below code

```javascript
var car = new Vehicle("Honda", "white", "2010", "UK");
console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
  this.year = year;
  this.country = country;
}
```

- 1: Undefined
- 2: ReferenceError
- 3: null
- 4: {model: "Honda", color: "white", year: "2010", country: "UK"}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The function declarations are hoisted similar to any variables. So the placement for `Vehicle` function declaration doesn't make any difference.

#### 2. What is the output of below code

```javascript
function foo() {
  let x = (y = 0);
  x++;
  y++;
  return x;
}

console.log(foo(), typeof x, typeof y);
```

- 1: 1, undefined and undefined
- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

- 2: B, A and C
- 3: A and C
- 4: A, C and B

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the fist statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

```

- 1: 1function
- 2: 1object
- 3: ReferenceError
- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

- 1: Hello World
- 2: Object {message: "Hello World"}
- 3: Undefined
- 4: SyntaxError

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

- 3: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4
- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

The important point is that if the statement contains the same operators(e.g, < or >) then it can be evaluated from left to right.
The first statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
2. console.log(true < 3);
3. console.log(1 < 3); // True converted as `1` during comparison
4. True

Whereas the second statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
2. console.log(true > 1);
3. console.log(1 > 1); // False converted as `0` during comparison

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true

#### 26. What is the output of below code

```javascript
async function func() {
  await 10;
}
console.log(func());
```

- 1: Promise {\<fulfilled\>: 10}
- 2: 10
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: Promise {\<resolved\>: undefined}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);
}
```

##### Answer: 1

Even though “processArray” is an async function, the anonymous function that we use for `forEach` is synchronous. If you use await inside a synchronous function then it throws a syntax error.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);
  }
  console.log("Process completed!");
}
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber (OR) typeof myString` is always the truthy value (either "number" or "string"). Since ! operator converts the value to a boolean value, the value of both `!typeof myNumber or !typeof myString` is always false. Hence the if condition fails and control goes to else block.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 2

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area();
```

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,

1. The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number
2. The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have undefined value in memory phase and throws an error '`getMessage` is not a function' at the code execution phase.

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

**Note:** We call the above queue as "MicroTask Queue"

#### 61. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
console.log('First line')
['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))
console.log('Third line')
```

- 1: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a new line, and finally print `Third line` as next line
- 2: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a first line, and  print `Third line` as next line
- 3:  Missing semi-colon error
- 4:  Cannot read properties of undefined

##### Answer: 4

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion` which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console.log('First line')['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.
